Yscreens
========

**Automatic...**

-   Screenshot maker
-   Screenshot and file uploader

**Information**  
Uploads a screenshot of the *primary* display, or a given file to the configured SSH-server,
 and puts the link directly to the clipboard, ready to paste.  
Files are named with a continuative number.  
Notifies with a standard Windows tray-popup if the upload finished.

Most of the things are configurable in the *yscreens.ini*.  
Leave *pw* blank in the *yscreens.ini* to use a key-file to authenticate.

For the tray-popup is cygwin needed, with *balloons.py*, that I got from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/15921588).
